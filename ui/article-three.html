      Our mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world.

      <p style="font-size:20px">
      We believe that everyone deserves to have a voice, and that the world is a better place when 
      we listen, share and build community through our stories.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px">
      Our values are based on four essential freedoms that define who we are.
      </p>
      <h3>Freedom of Expression</h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px">
      We believe people should be able to speak freely, share opinions, foster open dialogue, 
      and that creative freedom leads to new voices, formats and possibilities.
      </p>
      <h3>Freedom of Information</h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px">
      We believe everyone should have easy, open access to information and that video is a powerful 
      force for education, building understanding, and documenting world events, big and small.
