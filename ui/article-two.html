			<h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Bandcamp makes it easy for fans to directly connect with and support the artists they love.
        We treat music as art, not content, and we tie the success of our business to the success of 
        the artists who we serve.
      </p>
      <b>To date, fans have paid artists $232 million using Bandcamp, and $5.8 million in the last 30 days alone.</b>
      <p>We consider that a fine start, but only a start. We continue to work tirelessly to build an enduring service,
      one that treats artists fairly, puts them in control, and is integral to them building sustainable careers. 
      This approach has earned us our most valuable asset: trust. More than anything else, the trust of artists everywhere 
      is what makes Bandcamp work today, and it’s what will make Bandcamp grow far into the future. Whether you’re an art,fan, label, or all three, we hope you’ll be a part of it.</p>
